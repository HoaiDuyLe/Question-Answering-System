"context": "The software overview describes the GUI functionality of the BVe software.
The BVe software is a highly customized framework that can be adapted to run with different combinations of camera types, light control, and I/O communication. The software has an extensive array of inspection result data such as real-time results, mold or gripper position yield. This aids the end user to improve the process and ensure quality of the contact lens.
The BVe software is designed with two views, namely:
1) Main View : Main view displays Title Bar, Ribbon Tool Bar, Image inspection window, Logging window and Yield Graph Window.
Title Bar : Title Bar has the following information: Application Name, Logo and the Active Window information.
Ribbon Tool Bar : The Ribbon Tool Bar provides the shortcuts to the most important and frequently used functionalities.
Image Inspection wiindow : This window has real-time Inspection images. It also contains their results with the Tool, Position and Failure Type information as an overlay.
Logging window : Important logs such as user login, logout, mold blanking, parameter or setting change are displayed in this window. This information is saved automatically into an un-editable file.
2) Statistics View : Statistics view includes, real-time results, Mold or Gripper position yield, tool position yield, gripper yield, and defect counters. This aids the end user to improve the process and ensure quality of the contact lens.",

"context": "The IPIe Vision System will inspect individual positions of the blister strip for Lens and Saline presence,using Proprietory Illumination System, generating a pass/fail status to be accepted or rejected by the Primary Packaging (PP) line. The IPIe Vision System inspects for Missing Lenses, Multiple Lens, No Saline, Low Saline, No Blister Shell, Spot Defect, critical edge quality defects Edge Gap, Edge Tear, In Lens Tear, Deformed Lens, Lens Out of Position. The lenses are then rejected and disposed of further downline in the QA waste bin. Certain inspection features can be enabled or disabled to optimize the inspection process as needed.
The IPIe Inspection system is located on the Primary Packaging line between the Saline Dosing and Foil Placement systems. Lens inspection is performed in the primary packaging line while the lens is still in the carrier tray and when the lens is immersed in saline. Each CT has 5 lenses which forms a blister.
The Primary Packaging Line cycles through all five (5) positions of the blister strip with discrete I/O communication between the IPIe system and the PP line PLC. The PP line sends a discrete signal for each track to the IPIe unit to allow the system to start the inspection. Once the signal is received, the IPIe system sends a reply signal to halt the PP line and wait for the inspection results. After the IPIe finish processing, the system outputs inspection results to the PP line for blister strip acceptance or disposal.
